The multiple-choice package
v0.2

This package adjusts the choices of the multiple-choice question automatically.

It has been wholly inspired by the work of Enrico Gregorio
and improved by Vafa Khalighi and I've just packed and
redistributed it under the name of the `multiple-choice` package.

Current version release date: 2022/06/24
