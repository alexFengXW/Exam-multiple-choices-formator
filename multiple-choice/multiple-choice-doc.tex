\bigskip
\begin{multicols}{2}
The \xpackage{multiple-choice} package adjusts the choices of the multiple-choice question automatically.
It has been wholly inspired by the work of Enrico Gregorio\footnote{\url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/140923}}
and improved by Vafa Khalighi. I've just packed and redistributed it. It works with \XeLaTeX, \pdfLaTeX, and \LuaLaTeX.
Please, report any issues including bugs, typos in the documentation
or feature requests on \url{https://github.com/javadr/multiple-choice.sty/issues}.
